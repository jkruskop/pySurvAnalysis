"""Backend-agnostic document model for analysis reports.

This module is the contract between the analysis core and whatever engine
renders the report. It deliberately imports **nothing** from the analysis code
and **nothing** from any rendering library (reportlab, LaTeX, markdown, …).

A report is an ordered list of typed *blocks*. The analysis side builds this
structure from its data; a *backend* (see :mod:`pysurvanalysis.report_pkg.render`)
walks the blocks and produces a file. Swapping reportlab for a LaTeX or Markdown
engine means writing a new backend over these same blocks — the analysis core
never changes.

Design rules for anything added here:

* Pure data only — dataclasses of primitives, ``bytes``, and other blocks.
* No imports of matplotlib/reportlab/pandas. A :class:`Figure` carries already
  rendered image *bytes*, not a live matplotlib figure, so the model stays
  independent of how plots are drawn.
* Semantic, not presentational — a table row carries a :class:`Level`
  ("this row is good/bad"), never a hex color. Backends own the styling.
